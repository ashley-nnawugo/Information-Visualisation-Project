                The United Kingdom is a society which boasts of a large diversity. The diversity and ethnic spread is extremely important when looking at other facts and statistics.
                The population helps reason and understand the significance of certain facts and statisics. The visualisation below shows a comparison between different ethnic groups,
                the exact number can be seen when interacting with individual bars.

            <p class="w3-center">
                What is a infant morality? This is when a child has unfortunately died below the age of 1. This stacked area graph shows the rate at which infants die by ethniciy, each area representes
                100% of the value. Whites have the lowest infant mortality rates.

            <p class="w3-center">
                What is Stop and Search? Stop and Search are powers given to police others to intervene with individuals or groups, to keep the general population safe.
                These interventions are carried out on grounds that police officers suspect individuals or groups of drug offences, burglary, theft and or terrorism.
                The problem with stop and search tactics is that it is based on profiling of individuals, this profiling can bring out tendencies of racial discrimination.
                The graphs below show overall and normalised stop and search statisics from the period of 2009 to 2018. As the graph shows there has been a reduction of stop and searches
                as a result of reforms brought forward between 2013 to 2016.

            <p class="w3-center">
                When looking at the overall graph it shows that whites have the highest number of stop and searches, however this is because they are the majority in population.
                When the data is normalised, by dividing by the ethnic group population, the graph is much different.

            <p class="w3-center">
                What is household wealth? This is an entire families value, where value is measured by the difference between the value of a household's assets and the value 
                of its liabilities. Essentially this determines how rich and how much money a family owns. This graph visualises the differene in household wealth between 
                different ethnic groups by calculating a mean and median for each ethnic group. Increased household wealth gives children a better start in life.

                What is conviction rate? This is the rate at which suspects of crime who are charged end up being convicted of that crime. This graph visualises the percentage
                at which each ethniciy is convicted of a crime from the period of 2009 to 2017.

            <p class="w3-center">
                What is meant by a pay gap? Pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between the different ethnic groups. In this study we look at the pay gap between all ethnic groups
                against White British. A positive percentage above the white British signifies a negative pay gap, so they earnt less than White British and the opposite meaning they earnt more than White British.
                So in 2012, the Asian population earnt 12% less than their white British counter-parts.

                What is a low income home? Low income is determined by living less than 60% if the median income. A low income house live very close or if not in poverty.
                They live usually in poor living conditions, and sometimes struggle to put food on the table, heat their homes and pay their bills. 
                This graph visualises the percentage of ethnic groups who live in low income homes, with a comparison to the national average.

                As you can see from the data, ethnic minorities are disadvantaged in most aspects of life. 
                This includes pay, wealth, profiling from police, infant mortality and so on. However, ethnic minorities are not 
                discrimated against in court. 
                <br>
                <br>
                So how does your ethnicity impact your life in the UK?
                <br>
                If you are white British or white you are more likely to be convicted of crime. 
                <br>
                However if you are an ethnic minority
        you are more likely to 
                earn less, they are more like to possess less household wealth, more likely to live in a low income home, more likely
                to die before the age of 1 and more likely to be profiled by the police. This paints a much starker picture as an ethnic minority.
