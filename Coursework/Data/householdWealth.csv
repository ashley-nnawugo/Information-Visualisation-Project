Figure 3: Median total household wealth is highest for those with a White British head of the household,,
"Average total household wealth (£) by ethnicity of the household head; Great Britain, April 2016 to March 2018",,
,,
Notes,"1. Results for Great Britain include households where the ethnicity of the household head is unknown. 
2. Results for ‘Black – Other’ are not presented because the surveyed sample size is less than 30 households. Results for the Bangladeshi and Chinese ethnic groups are based on less than 50 unweighted cases and such data should be treated with some caution. 
3. We recommend comparing median measures of wealth where possible as it accounts for the fact that wealth is positively skewed, and the mean can be highly affected by large values and outliers.",
